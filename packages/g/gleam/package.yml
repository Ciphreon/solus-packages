summary    : A friendly language for building type-safe systems that scale.
description: |
    Gleam is a friendly language for building type-safe systems that scale.
    The power of a type system, the expressiveness of functional programming, and the reliability of the highly concurrent, fault tolerant Erlang runtime, with a familiar and modern syntax.
    Gleam comes with compiler, build tool, formatter, editor integrations, and package manager all built in.
    As part of the wider BEAM ecosystem, Gleam programs can use thousands of published packages, whether they are written in Gleam, Erlang, or Elixir.
    Gleam can additionally compile to JavaScript, enabling you to use your code in the browser, or anywhere else JavaScript can run.
