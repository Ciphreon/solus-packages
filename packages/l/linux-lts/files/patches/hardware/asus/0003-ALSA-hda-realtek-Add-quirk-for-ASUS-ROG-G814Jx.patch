Subject: [PATCH 3/3] ALSA: hda/realtek: Add quirk for ASUS ROG G814Jx

Adds the required quirk to enable the Cirrus amp and correct pins
on the ASUS ROG G814J series which uses an SPI connected Cirrus amp.

While this works if the related _DSD properties are made available, these
aren't included in the ACPI of these laptops (yet).
